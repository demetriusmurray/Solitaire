# Solitaire
Originally developed as part of a text-based Casino app in a 5-person team. Refactoring my contribution to the project for this page

## Upcoming
- Before anything else, let's get some tests in here. TDD FTW!
- Build control loop for game play, utilizing the functional enums.
- Determine logic for starting and ending the game.
- Other dope things as needed.
